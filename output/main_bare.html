<h1 id="hello">Hello</h1>
<p>This repository is an example on how to use a Github Action.</p>
<p>It has a Markdown file and using a Github Action uses Pandoc to
generate HTML, PDF, etc. and pushes the generated files into another
Github repo.</p>
<p>Now it has stricter shell options.</p>
<p>And now… names in entrypoint.sh and names in action.yml are
aligned.</p>
<p>Testing now with the COMMIT_MESSAGE (default)</p>
<p>Now testing with –set-upstream</p>
<p>Now testing after
https://github.com/cpina/github-action-push-to-another-repository/pull/41</p>
<p>Now testing after adding support for github hosts other than
github.com (again, 2, 3)</p>
<p>Testing that the check for a branch works… if it exist</p>
<p>Testing after a small change in main (GitHub repository username)</p>
<p>Another test just in case</p>
<p>Another test with the right branch.</p>
<p>Fix / else / then is tested</p>
<p>Testing on 20th of February 2023</p>
